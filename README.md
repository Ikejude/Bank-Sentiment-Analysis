# Bank-Sentiment-Analysis

This is a machine learning model for predicting the sentiment analysis of a bank's customers in Nigeria using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features and characteristics of customers' feedback, we can build a model that predicts the behaviours of the customers on its attributes. This can be useful for anyone interested in predicting the likelihood of customers churning a bank's products or services.

## About

The Bank Sentiment Analysis project utilizes machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model for predicting the sentiment of customers using a Bank's product and service. By analyzing a dataset consisting of the survey of customers' bahaviour and sentiment and their associated features, the project aims to build a model capable of predicting the sentiment of customers for new instances.

The project implements various machine learning techniques, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The code and documentation provide a clear understanding of the process and allow users to replicate or extend the project according to their requirements.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing the market survey of customers' sentiment and related attributes. The dataset consists of features such as gender, age range, questions on certain features, etc. Each customer in the dataset has an associated sentiment, which serves as the target variable for prediction.
The dataset is included in this repository.

## Installation

1. To run the House Price Prediction project locally, follow these steps:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bank-Sentiment-Analysis.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Bank-Sentiment-Analysis
3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies.
4. [Optional] If you have the dataset, place it in the data directory.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred development environment or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Navigate to the notebooks directory.
3. Open the sentiment_analysis_bank.ipynb notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
You can modify the notebook or add your own code to experiment with different techniques and improve the model's performance.
